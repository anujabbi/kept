# DECISIONS

Choices made where the handoff brief was open, or where this build deliberately departs from it.
The kickoff Q&A answers are recorded first; everything after was decided during implementation.

## From the kickoff Q&A

1. **Lock model is default-deny.** Every launchable app is locked during the lock window until
   habits are done. The user can add a short list of exceptions. The handoff's user-curated
   blocklist is gone; `BlockedApp` became `AllowedApp`.
2. **Buddy is a local stub.** `BuddyRepository` is an interface; `LocalStubBuddyRepository`
   accepts any `XXX-XXX` code and seeds "Maya". No network.
3. **Proof types: TIMER, MANUAL, PHOTO.** Health Connect is deferred; the enum has no slot for it
   so nothing pretends to support it.
4. **Tamper visibility instead of tamper resistance.** No device admin. If usage access is off or
   the service is dead during a lock window, a `ProtectionGap` is recorded and that day is
   `unprotected`: it cannot count for the streak, the recap says so, and the buddy grid shows a
   hollow square.
5. **Growth is evolution creatures.** Sprig has 8 forms unlocked by streak milestones (3, 7, 14,
   30, 60, 100) plus a buddy-only Duo form at a 7-day pair streak. Forms are collected in a
   gallery with a deterministic weekly variant (colour + accessory) and shared as PNG cards.

## During implementation

- **Level and streak are decoupled.** Level goes up the moment the last habit completes (a
  same-day reward) and down on a lock break. Streak and evolution are decided at rollover. The
  handoff tied level-up to rollover; moving it earlier makes finishing feel immediate.
- **A broken day still counts for the streak if the habits get done.** The handoff said a break
  "marks the day as not counting". That made a single slip cost the whole streak on top of a level
  and a wilt, which felt punitive enough to drive uninstalls. Now: break costs a level and wilts
  Sprig; only the 4th break in a rolling week writes the day off.
- **Break unlock length is configurable (15/30/60 min, default 30)** instead of "until due".
  An hour-long unlock for a one-minute need is a loophole; a short window is honest friction.
- **Shield is not consumed on a zero streak.** Nothing to protect, so it stays for a day that
  matters.
- **Global lock window instead of per-habit windows.** One `lockFrom`/`due` pair in settings.
  Per-habit windows were in the handoff data model but not on any screen.
- **Bottom nav: Today, Sprig, Buddy, Settings.** The handoff's second tab (stats) became the
  Sprig gallery. History lives under Settings and each row opens that day's recap.
- **Sprig is drawn on a Canvas, not from VectorDrawables.** Path data from the five SVGs is
  parsed at runtime with `PathParser`, so forms, variants, wilt and accessories can be layered
  and recoloured from one source. The same draw function renders the share bitmap.
- **Debug seeding is opt-in.** In debug builds the seeder runs only when the app is launched with
  `--ez seed true`, so onboarding can still be tested on a debug install.
- **Onboarding has five steps, not three.** Habits, rule, exceptions (needed by default-deny),
  permissions, meet Sprig.
- **Watchdog worker every 15 minutes** re-starts the service, runs pending rollovers, and records
  a protection gap when the heartbeat is older than 2 minutes during a lock window. Rollover is a
  one-time work request re-armed for 00:05 each day, plus catch-up on app open so multi-day gaps
  are processed day by day.
- **Camera permission is only requested if a PHOTO habit exists**, and only on devices with a
  camera.
- **The Duo form's pair streak is derived from the stub's deterministic history**
  (`buddyDoneOn(date)`), so the loop is demonstrable without a backend.
- **`QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES` is declared** because default-deny needs the full launchable set both to
  decide what to lock and to build the exceptions picker. Justified in the manifest comment.
- **Emergency call uses `ACTION_DIAL`** which needs no permission; the dialer, telecom and
  emergency packages are in the static allowlist and role holders are added at runtime.
- **Room `fallbackToDestructiveMigration`** is on for v1 (schema version 1, exported to
  `app/schemas`). Replace with real migrations before shipping an update.
